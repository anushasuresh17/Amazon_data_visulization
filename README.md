I have conducted extensive data analysis using Power BI, leveraging a cleaned dataset that has been preprocessed to handle null values. Through my analysis, I have gained valuable insights into the Amazon dataset, which includes product information such as categories, subcategories, rating counts, discount percentages, and more.

- **Top 10 Categories by Rating Count:** I identified the top 10 categories based on their rating counts, providing valuable information about the most popular product categories.

- **Category vs. Discount Percentage (Stacked Bar Chart):** By comparing categories against discount percentages, I visualized how discounts vary across different product categories, aiding in understanding promotional strategies.

- **Rating vs. Discount Percentage (Scatter Plot):** Through a scatter plot, I analyzed the relationship between product ratings and their corresponding discount percentages, helping to uncover patterns between customer satisfaction and pricing.

- **Rating Distribution (Donut Chart):** Utilizing a donut chart, I displayed the distribution of product ratings, allowing for a quick grasp of the overall customer feedback.

- **Top Products by Rating Count (Table):** I created a table listing the top products based on their rating counts, showcasing the most popular products according to customer reviews.

- **Category and Sub-Category Analysis (Matrix):** By using a matrix visualization, I explored the relationship between categories and sub-categories, along with the total number of products in each combination, providing a comprehensive view of the product catalog organization.

Throughout these analyses, I demonstrated my proficiency in data visualization and business intelligence using Power BI. The insights obtained from these visualizations offer valuable guidance for strategic decision-making, marketing efforts, and product performance evaluations. My ability to effectively analyze data and derive actionable insights is a valuable asset for any organization seeking data-driven solutions to enhance business performance.
